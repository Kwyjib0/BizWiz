BizWiz app will give the user the ability to ask questions and/or answer questions about any small business related topics as a business owner. The features of the app will be aligned with a typical CRUD app. The home page should have the name of the industry that the Q&As are relevant to. When clicking the industry you should have the ability to see all the questions and answers given so far with the option to ask a question or give an answer on that page. The questions and answers submitted will enter the database and be on display after submissions. If you click on a question or answer that is already there you are taken to a page for that specific question or answer with the ability to comment on it or see other comments on that question.
